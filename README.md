A virtually AIO Soviet type space center for rival space programs. Originally created by forum user **Divico** and published at [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/85861-*/).

This mod was requested by @Angel-125 for use in JNSQ for his own Soviet program. Although he was informed soon after that JNSQ already catered for this and I no longer needed to continue this work, I decided to continue, regardless, for the enjoyment of others.

## Features
* Three rocket pads. The Gagarin pad is open by default for starters.
* One helipad.
* One runway with two spawn points. The terminal roadside spawn point is open by default for starters.
* The plateau has a high-powered (for the early game: 420km) built-in DSN antenna.
* Plateau is colored to fit JNSQ Kerbin desert, not stock Kerbin desert.
* Flood lights animate on click.
* Positions itself correctly (with MapDecal) on stock Kerbin and JNSQ Kerbin.
